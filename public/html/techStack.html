                <h2>HTML, CSS, and JS</h2>
                <p>Starting out with this project, 
                had to figure out HTML, CSS, and JS. I personally
                think the hardest to learn was CSS. CSS has 
                so many things to wrap my head around so 
                as you saw from <a href="./beginning.html">here</a> 
                I didn't do too much styling in the beginning. 
                </p>
                <h1 style="font-size: 50px; opacity: 0;">filler text</h1>
                <p>HTML and JS were surprisingly
                not too bad as HTML is rather simple with all the tags. Javascript 
                also wasn't too bad because I perviously learned java in highschool.
                </p>
                <h2>Node.js</h2>
                <p>When trying to make this game, I figured 
                I need a way to make the game logic run on the webpage.
                Fortunately, this is where I picked up Node.js. 
                </p>
                <h2>Express and Socket.io</h2>
                <p>When I took a look at my professor's project, 
                    I saw unfamiliar syntax related to 
                    express, app, and server. The reason why I
                    ended up picking them up for this project was 
                    because I needed a way to have different users 
                    connect and interact with each other.
                </p>

                    <strong>Note:</strong> <p>Although this 
                    is my first project that is web based,
                    I had made something similar that connected a GUI to postgreSQL.
