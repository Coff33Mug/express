                <h1>Server and Sockets</h1>
                <h2>Creating a server</h2>
                <p>Through a youtube video, a bit of documentation, 
                    and my professor's project as reference,
                    I was able to set up a server using express which dealt 
                    with self connections to my local device.
                </p>
                <div class="noteBox"><Strong>Note:</Strong><p>
                    Prior to this project, I was considering using Spring Boot and Java for my backend
                </p></div>
                <h2>Sockets and rooms</h2>
                <p>Alongside Express for users to connect to a server, 
                    I picked up socket.io to allow users to communicate with each other.
                    I took some of the information from the youtube videos 
                    which dealt with sending client to client messages and instead
                    took a client's input and expressed it to everyone connected 
                    in the form of points and their roll of dice.
                </p>

                <p>Frankly the most time consuming and difficult part 
                    of this project ended up being rooms. I figured out about rooms early in 
                    the project when looking through socket documentation 
                    and thought it was super interesting. The reason for 
                    implementing rooms allowed for multiple games to be
                    going on at the same time.
                </p>

                    This was the buggiest feature I've made!
                    Tons of testing were required to fix bugs
                    such as:
                </p>
                <p>- improper count of players being displayed</p>
                <p>- removing users under multiple circumstances</p>
                <p>- rooms not being successfully joined due to socket ID changes</p>
                <p> and so much more... check out the commit history for all of them.</p>
